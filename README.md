# PlantAI

PlantAI is a machine learning project designed to identify plants based on their images. The project leverages Python and Streamlit to create an interactive and user-friendly platform for plant identification.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes trained models to identify plants.
- **Streamlit Web Interface**: An intuitive interface to interact with the model.
- **Customizable**: Modify and extend the functionality as needed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Pipenv or another Python package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/superuser303/PlantAI.git
   cd PlantAI
   ```
